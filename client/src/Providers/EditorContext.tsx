 * editor that started it — React Query keeps it — and an editor that appears
 * while one is running has to see it. Reading the mutation cache makes "a save
 * is in flight" true exactly while one is, so no session can release a lock it
 * does not hold and none can be left behind by a pane the user closed.

/**
 * Code state context - for components that need the current code content
 * Changes frequently (on every keystroke), so only subscribe if needed.
 *
 * The buffer carries the artifact it belongs to. The pane is remounted when it
 * changes hosts (side panel, mobile sheet, undocked window), so whether the
 * buffer is this artifact's unsaved text cannot be decided from a mount.
 *
 * `rejectedCode` is session state rather than editor-instance state because a
 * remount is a host change, not a new decision by the user. It is recorded per
 * artifact for the same reason as the code buffer: a rejection for one
 * artifact must neither suppress a save for another nor be overwritten by
 * another's refusal.
 *
 * A buffer another artifact displaces is retained under the artifact it
 * belongs to: the edit's debounce died with the selection change, so the
 * retained copy is the only place that text still lives, and the editor that
 * gets the artifact back restores and sends it from there.
 *
 * `codeSession` is the editing session the buffer belongs to. A save keeps its
 * callbacks after the editor that started it is gone, and those callbacks
 * would otherwise write the buffer a closed session just cleared and submit
 * its queued edit — so they compare the session they were started in against
 * this live counter. It is a mutable object rather than a value because the
 * comparison happens after the reader's last render.
 *
 * Ending a session leaves a running save alone: the request is not the
 * session's to cancel, and nothing waits on a flag it could clear.
 *
 * `savedContent` is what this tab knows the server holds for each artifact,
 * read and written synchronously because save callbacks run between renders.
 * It outlives a session: the server's content does not change when the pane
 * closes.
