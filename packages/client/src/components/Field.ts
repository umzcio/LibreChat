/**
 * The shared appearance of a form control: border, radius, type scale and focus
 * treatment. Owned here so `Input`, `Textarea`, and the select/combobox triggers
 * that have to sit beside them in a form cannot drift apart as the theme evolves.
 * Callers compose a variant rather than restating these classes locally. The
 * border is `border-control` because it is the only edge the control has, so a
 * palette can raise it to the 3:1 non-text floor without touching separators.
 * A theme whose `fieldFocusStyle` is `border` focuses the field by swapping that edge to
 * `border-field-focus`; keyboard focus adds a 1px ring in the same color, so the indicator keeps
 * the 2px perimeter the app holds as its focus floor. The value inks in `field-text`, and a theme
 * whose `fieldFillStyle` is `fill` paints the field in `field-fill`, which a disabled field keeps
 * under the pointer too; by default it stays clear.
